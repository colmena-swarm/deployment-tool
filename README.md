# COLMENA Deployment Tool Repository

This GitHub repository contains all the files and software necessary to deploy applications on a COLMENA platform. COLMENA (COLaboración entre dispositivos Mediante tecnología de ENjAmbre) aims to ease the development, deployment, operation and maintenance of extremely-high available, reliable and intelligent services running seamlessly across the device-edge-cloud continuum. It leverages a swarm approach organising a dynamic group of autonomous, collaborative nodes following an agile, fully-decentralised, robust, secure and trustworthy open architecture.

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisits
 - Create a COLMENA service bundle using the COLMENA Programming Model
 - Clone this repository at <COLMENA_dt_path>
 - Create COLMENA platform on the desired infrastructure

### Running the service
Install dependencies:
```bash
python3 -m pip install .
```

Deploy an application on COLMENA:
``` bash
python3 -m deployment/colmena_deploy \
	--build_path="<path_to_the_service_root>/<service_modulename>/build" \
	--platform="linux/amd64" \
	--user=${DOCKER_USERNAME}
```
Multi-architecture builds (for example: --platform="linux/amd64,linux/arm64) are also supported, 
but configuration of Docker is needed (steps to follow here: https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-platform/).

For a full list of the deployment tool parameters:
```bash
python3 -m deployment/colmena_deploy -h
```


### Within a docker instance
1. Build the image locally
	```bash
	docker --debug build -t colmenaswarm/deployment-tool:latest .
	```
2. Execute the image mounting as a volume the build folder of the service
	``` bash
	docker run --rm \
		-v ~/.docker/config.json:/root/.docker/config.json \
		-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
		-v <path_to_the_service_root>/<service_modulename>/build:/app \
		--network=host \
		colmenaswarm/deployment-tool:latest \
		--build_path=/app\
		--platform="linux/amd64" \
		--user=${DOCKER_USERNAME}
	```
